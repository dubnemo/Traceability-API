My great grandfather was a satisfied man
Contented in every way
Such was the course of his everyday life
'Til he heard of the seven rays
'Til he heard of the seven rays
'Til he heard

Every modern man, in the back of his mind
Has a problem to face
He wants security for the home in his head
All he needs is the seven rays
All he needs is the seven rays
All he needs

And when you think about tomorrow
What goes through your mind?
Now don't nobody get uptight
Do you think that we can put up
With this shit one more night
All you need is the six more rays
All you need is the six more rays
All you need

Take one beam of light
Prism acquire
Break the white light down
Seven rays appear, seven rays appear

One: red, the ruler seeking freedom
Two: gold, the father seeking unity
Three: orange, the thinker seeking understanding
Four: yellow, the poet seeking harmony

Take the seven rays
Pure as fire
Focus anywhere
White light will appear, white light will appear

Five: green, the scientist seeking truth
Six: blue, the disciple seeking goodness
Seven: indigo, the artist seeking beauty

One: freedom
Two: beauty
Three: understanding
Four: harmony
Five: truth
Six: goodness
Seven: beauty

This may sound like a bunch of trumped up words
But we keep no secrets today
The only hope for you is in your brothers, my friend
All you need is just six more rays
All we need is the seven rays
All we need is the seven rays
All we need is the seven rays
All we need
All we need
All we need
